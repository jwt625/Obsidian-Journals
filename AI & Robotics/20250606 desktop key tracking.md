Maybe worth a separate repo?

2025-06-06T22:09:38-07:00
Going to implement proper event logging.

2025-06-06T22:50:06-07:00
Made the buckets finer. Still need to update the grafana.

Testing adding keystroke every second.

2025-06-07T00:52:06-07:00
added clicks.

2025-06-07T09:25:28-07:00
Changed layout as well as added proper max session duration metric

This query is art, I have no freaking idea what or why the hell it looks like this:
```SQL
histogram_quantile(1.0, sum by (le, app) (increase(app_session_duration_seconds_bucket[$__range])) * on(app) group_left() (sum by (app) (increase(app_session_duration_seconds_count[$__range])) > 0))
```

This actually look quite regular, esp. the pulses into obsidian.

2025-06-08T21:01:48-07:00
Filtering out the loginwindow:
```SQL
histogram_quantile(1.0,

sum by (le, app) (

increase(app_session_duration_seconds_bucket{app!~"loginwindow|finder|dock|.*window.*"}[$__range])

)

* on(app) group_left()

(

sum by (app) (increase(app_session_duration_seconds_count{app!~"loginwindow|finder|dock|.*window.*"}[$__range])) > 10

)

)
```


Should work on the chrome extension, look at this:

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the requested Chrome tab
  session duration tracking and resolved the circular import issue.
  Here's what has been completed:

  ‚úÖ Domain-Aware Metrics Implementation Complete

  Key Changes Made:

  1. Fixed Circular Import Issue: Removed metrics/helpers.go and moved
  getDomainForApp() helper function directly into keyboard and trackpad
  packages
  2. Added Chrome Tab Session Metrics: Enhanced metrics with new
  Chrome-specific tracking:
    - chrome_tab_session_duration_seconds - Histogram of Chrome tab
  focus sessions by domain
    - chrome_tab_total_time_seconds - Total time spent on each Chrome
  domain
    - current_chrome_tab_session_seconds - Real-time gauge of current
  tab session
  3. Enhanced Chrome Monitoring:
    - Session tracking with start/end times for each domain
    - Automatic session recording when switching between domains
    - Real-time gauge updates during active sessions
  4. Updated All Tracking Packages: All metrics now include optional
  domain labels:
    - keystrokes_total{key_type="letter", app="google_chrome", 
  domain="github_com"}
    - mouse_clicks_total{button_type="left", app="google_chrome", 
  domain="youtube_com"}
    - keystroke_interval_activity{app="google_chrome", 
  key_type="letter", domain="stackoverflow_com"}

  Ready for Testing:
  The system now tracks comprehensive Chrome tab session durations
  similar to app session tracking, providing fine-grained visibility
  into time spent on different domains. All data flows through
  Prometheus for complete observability.

Chrome extension does not have write access to arb. locations, but it oes have download folder?



2025-06-08T23:13:35-07:00
It has decided to do POST to a http endpoint of the extension from the go server to get the into
 Simplified HTTP-Based Chrome Integration Complete!

  I've completely eliminated the complex file-based and native messaging
   approach and implemented a much simpler direct HTTP communication:

  üåê How It Works Now:

  1. Chrome Extension: Sends domain updates directly via fetch() to
  http://localhost:8080/chrome-update
  2. Go Application: Receives HTTP POST requests and immediately updates
   Chrome domain
  3. Zero File I/O: No temp files, no Downloads folder, no native
  messaging host

  üì° HTTP Communication:

  Chrome Extension sends:
  fetch('http://localhost:8080/chrome-update', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      type: 'current_domain',
      domain: 'youtube_com',
      url: 'https://youtube.com/...'
    })
  })

  Go Application responds:
  {"status": "ok", "domain": "youtube_com"}

  üöÄ To Test:

  4. Reload the Chrome extension (to get updated permissions and code)
  5. Start the tracker: ./start.sh
  6. Navigate between websites in Chrome
  7. Check Go logs - should immediately show "üåê Chrome domain via HTTP:
   youtube_com"
  8. Check extension debug popup - should show "working (HTTP)" status

  This approach is much simpler and real-time - no polling, no file
  watching, just direct HTTP calls when domains change. The domains
  should now appear immediately in your Go logs and flow through to
  Prometheus metrics!

Ok it is working:
