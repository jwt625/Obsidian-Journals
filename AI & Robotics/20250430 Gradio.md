# Deploy on HF
2025-05-01T01:11:18-07:00
Trying to deploy Gradio on Hugging face.
git not working.
chat recommend install and log in with HF CLI.
- `git remote add hf git@huggingface.co:spaces/jwt625/BPM.git`
- still not authorized...
login seems fine:
![[Pasted image 20250501011711.png]]
2025-05-01T01:19:38-07:00
Removed all remote and re-add the hf one:
![[Pasted image 20250501011945.png]]
- is this expected?
- chat says so.
- 2025-05-01T01:20:32-07:00 ok seems like it is pusing.
```
wentaojiang@Mac BPM % git push --set-upstream hf main

ssh: connect to host huggingface.co port 22: Operation timed out
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
```

Trying to re-add with `git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/jwt625/BPM.git`
- now same access error
- ![[Pasted image 20250501012457.png]]


Is the token wrong??

- adding more read/write access.

2025-05-01T01:31:17-07:00
wait this worked?
![[Pasted image 20250501013120.png]]
Seems so.
Now got config error:
![[Pasted image 20250501013144.png]]
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/jwt625/BPM
- seems like I should have kept the old readme
![[Pasted image 20250501013228.png]]

2025-05-01T01:34:12-07:00
Now it is running, sick!
![[Pasted image 20250501013417.png]]

## Summary

Code that made the token work:
```
git remote set-url hf \            
https://jwt625:<TOKEN>@huggingface.co/spaces/jwt625/bpm.git
```

And then push with `git push hf main `
