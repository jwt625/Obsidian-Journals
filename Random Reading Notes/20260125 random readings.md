Polycrystalline diamond is a promising material for MEMS resonators due to its remarkable mechanical and electrical properties and compatibility with standard semiconductor manufacturing processes. However, the growth on non-diamond substrates is challenging, and a seeding process is needed to grow closed thin films. Hot filament chemical vapor deposition and reactive ion etching are powerful tools to deposit and micromachine diamond thin films on silicon substrates. In this paper, a polycrystalline diamond thin film …

A small liquid droplet placed on an asymmetric ratchet surface heated above the Leidenfrost temperature is known to self-propel. Here, we examine an alternative configuration: a heated macroscopic alumina boat (14 cm long) decorated with asymmetric ratchets and floated in volatile perfluorocarbon liquid. Boats with 1 mm pitch ratchets, heated to 280 °C, showed robust self-propulsion in the expected direction, reaching several centimeters per second and traveling more than one meter. An impulse–momentum balance scaling, derived from Leidenfrost droplet propulsion, predicts boat velocities of the same order but somewhat below experiments, suggesting enhanced efficiency of vapor flow in contact with bulk liquid. Propulsion efficiency depends strongly on ratchet geometry: for small pitches, bottom and sidewall ratchets act synergistically, while at larger pitches, sidewall ratchets reduce thrust by redirecting vapor. Herringbone-patterned ratchets further enhanced propulsion. Towing tests confirmed reduced drag when boats moved with their ratchet orientation, with  lower drag coefficients compared to smooth boats.

We report on an educational pilot program for low-cost physics experimentation run in Ecuador, South Africa, and the United States. The program was developed after having needs-based discussions with African educators, researchers, and leaders. It was determined that the need and desire for low-cost, skills-building, and active-learning tools is very high. From this, we developed a 3D-printable, Raspberry Pi-based multispectral camera (15 to 25 spectral channels in the visible and near-IR) for as little as $100. The …

A single-polarization hollow-core anti-resonant fiber (HC-ARF) with an asymmetric cladding and double-layer nested elliptical tube is designed and analyzed. Along the X-axis, the outer elliptic tube with gradually varying wall thickness and the inner elliptic tube with a uniform wall thickness enhance the loss of the X-polarized fundamental mode (FM). In the Y-axis direction, the double-layer elliptic tube with a uniform wall thickness suppresses the loss of Y-polarized FM to improve the polarization loss ratio (PLR). Theoretical analysis reveals that …

This article demonstrates a novel partial negative curvature hollow-core fiber for low-loss terahertz transmission. In the optimized fiber structure, the tubes in the vertical direction are replaced by plate-like dielectric sheets, thereby achieving low loss and low blocked risk of 3D printing, while retaining a small fiber hollow core and fiber diameter. The 3D printed fiber is characterized by a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system. The obtained transmission spectrum demonstrates the mode beating phenomenon and its peak position varies periodically with fiber length at short distances. The thin antiresonant walls endow the fiber with two broad low-loss windows of 0.2–0.4 THz and 0.55–0.85 THz. Besides, the x-polarization and y-polarization waves achieve minimum losses of 16.2 dB/m@0.28 THz and 16.0 dB/m@0.29 THz, respectively. Furthermore, our fiber has low experimental dispersions, namely −0.18±1.1 ps/THz/cm (x-pol) and 0.67 ± 0.77 ps/THz/cm (y-pol). The experimental losses and dispersions match well with the simulation results. Additionally, the simulation results reveal that the fiber has the potential to attain a high birefringence of 10−3.

While remaining compatible with III-nitride material systems and other materials utilized in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor applications, II–IV-nitride materials offer opportunities to broaden the semiconductor platform with new properties and/or new functionalities. MgSiN2 stands out among other II–IV-nitrides because of its ultrawide bandgap, enabling its potential applications in the ultraviolet-C region, while also being a promising candidate to exhibit ferroelectricity. In this work, a comprehensive study of MgSiN2 film growth on sapphire substrates via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition was performed to correlate the growth conditions with the properties of these films. The effects of the growth temperature from 745 to 960 °C, the NH3 molar flow rate, the Mg:Si flow rate ratio, and the growth pressure, from 450 to 550 Torr, on the crystallinity and surface morphology of MgSiN2 films were investigated. The cation-ordered orthorhombic single-crystal structure was observed via high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy in a sample grown at 945 °C. The refractive index of an MgSiN2 film was measured using ellipsometry. Optical transmittance measurements revealed a direct bandgap in the range of 6.13–6.39 eV, depending on the growth conditions. Optical absorption at wavelengths below the direct bandgap was higher than that predicted by two orders of magnitude, obscuring efforts to measure the indirect gap.
