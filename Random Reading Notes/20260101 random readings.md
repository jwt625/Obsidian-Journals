Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations, which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics. In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to ±100 MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 _µ_V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than ±7 MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a 1_/f_ trend above 10−4 Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.

Intermolecular electronic couplings (IECs) play a critical role in theories of charge and excitation transfer. However, the considerable computational cost of evaluating IECs limits the exploration of large molecular systems and long timescales key to numerous molecular and materials applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer a means of accelerating IEC predictions, enabling previously intractable calculations for large disordered systems and their optoelectronic properties. In this pedagogical review, we summarize recent progress in applying ML to predict IECs and leverage a case study of IEC prediction applied to a canonical molecular dopant and organic semiconductor system to illustrate conformational data sampling, feature engineering, and ML algorithms. For each step, we discuss the existing challenges and outline future research directions to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and transferability of ML models for IEC predictions.

Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing offers a unique synergy of high resolution, flexible substrate compatibility, and environmentally friendly and cost-effective process, making it ideal for next-generation terahertz (THz) metasurfaces, especially those that are conformal, customized, or integrated into flexible systems. For example, in applications such as wearable THz sensors, curvy cloaks, or on-demand functional prototypes, EHD printing outperforms conventional methods such as photolithography, laser writing, and nanoimprint lithography in terms of adaptability and integration flexibility. However, current maskless EHD printing is hindered by several challenges, including insufficient conductivity that weakens resonance strength, suboptimal edge definition that compromises the fidelity of meta-atom features, and low throughput that restricts large-area scalability. Here, we introduce a mask etching process (MEP) integrated with EHD printing to address these limitations, enabling the fabrication of large-area, high-resolution (<10 _μ_m) THz metasurfaces. The conductivity is improved sixfold, achieving 3.33 × 107 S/m, which is remarkably close to the bulk conductivity of gold (4.52 × 107 S/m). Both simulations and experimental results substantiate that the fabricated THz metasurfaces exhibit exceptional electromagnetic characteristics, including efficient absorption and filtering. This MEP-enhanced EHD printing strategy thus provides a versatile, scalable, and cost-effective approach for high-resolution THz metasurface fabrication. Moreover, it can be readily extended to other similar devices requiring high-resolution patterning and large-area array integration.

Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet printing is an emerging technique in the field of additive manufacturing. Due to its versatility in the inks it can print, and most importantly, the printing resolution it can achieve, it is rapidly gaining favor for application in the manufacture of electronic devices, sensors, and displays among others. Although it is an affordable and accessible manufacturing process, it does require excellent operational understanding to achieve high resolution printing of up to 50 nm as reported in literature. In this review, three main aspects are considered, namely, the ink properties, the printer system itself (including design, nozzle dimensions, applied potential, and others), and the substrate onto which printing is being carried out. Knowing how all these factors can be manipulated and brought together allows the users of EHD printing to achieve extraordinary resolution and consistent results. The review is concluded with a brief discussion on where one can see the potential for development in this field of research.

To overcome the limitation of low production speed of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) [inkjet printing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/inkjet-printing "Learn more about inkjet printing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") technology and to fabricate low cost electronic micro-structures, this paper presents the direct deposition of copper colloidal solution through the multi-nozzle EHD inkjet printing process. Multi-nozzle EHD inkjet printing head, consisting of five nozzles, was used for simultaneous printing of electrically conductive micro-tracks onto the [glass substrate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/glass-substrate "Learn more about glass substrate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Nozzle-to-nozzle distance and experimental conditions were optimized to prevent the interaction i.e., cross-talk between electrically charged neighboring jets. After sintering in inert (N2 gas) atmosphere, printed tracks exhibited approximately five times larger resistivity (9.20 μΩ cm) than that of the bulk copper which is a remarkable achievement. These electrically conductive micro-tracks show the feasibility of multi-nozzle EHD inkjet printing technique using the copper nano-colloidal ink for low cost fabrication of microelectronic structures and devices.

Inkjet printing of electrode using copper nanoparticle ink is presented. Electrode was printed on a flexible glass epoxy composite substrate using drop on demand piezoelectric dispenser and was sintered at 200 °C of low temperature in N2 gas condition. The printed electrodes were made with various widths and thickness. In order to control the thickness of the printed electrode, number of printing was varied. Resistivity of printed electrode was calculated from the cross-sectional area measured by a profilometer and resistance measured by a digital multimeter. Surface morphology of electrode was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). From the study, it was found that 10 times printed electrode has the most stable grain structure and low resistivity of 36.7 nΩ m.

Nanotechnology, with its broad impact on societally relevant applications, relies heavily on the availability of accessible nanofabrication methods. Even though a host of such techniques exists, the flexible, inexpensive, on-demand and scalable fabrication of functional nanostructures remains largely elusive. Here we present a method involving nanoscale electrohydrodynamic ink-jet printing that may significantly contribute in this direction. A combination of nanoscopic placement precision, soft-landing fluid dynamics, rapid solvent vapourization, and subsequent self-assembly of the ink colloidal content leads to the formation of scaffolds with base diameters equal to that of a single ejected nanodroplet. The virtually material-independent growth of nanostructures into the third dimension is then governed by an autofocussing phenomenon caused by local electrostatic field enhancement, resulting in large aspect ratio. We demonstrate the capabilities of our electrohydrodynamic printing technique with several examples, including the fabrication of plasmonic nanoantennas with features sizes down to 50 nm.

We demonstrate a polarization-insensitive electro-optic (EO) modulator based on x-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), employing capacitively loaded traveling-wave (CLTW) electrodes on an undercut-etched silicon substrate. By converting the TM0 mode into a higher-order TE1 mode via adiabatic mode converters and modulating both TE0 and TE1 modes simultaneously in a multimode Mach–Zehnder interferometer, polarization-insensitive modulation is achieved without duplicating modulators or control circuits. The fabricated device exhibits a polarization-dependent loss (PDL) of 2.2 dB, a modulation efficiency of _V_π_L_ = 3.12 V cm, and a 3-dB EO bandwidth of 43 GHz for both modes. High-speed data transmission is experimentally verified with clear eye diagrams up to 100 Gb/s (OOK) and 112 Gb/s (PAM-4) for both polarizations. These results highlight the feasibility of dual-mode modulation for polarization-insensitive interconnects and support its potential for deployment in co-packaged optics (CPO) and remote external light sources related transmitter systems.

Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride are based on fluorescent point-like defects. These defects possess exceptional photophysical properties and have been the focus of research for their potential to advance photonic quantum technologies. However, achieving scalable integration of these emitters onto arbitrary platforms with high yield while retaining their characteristics remains challenging when the substrate is incompatible with the fabrication method. In this work, we introduce an all-dry transfer method that addresses these challenges more effectively than existing techniques. This polymer stamp-assisted transfer maintains high output and preserves emitter characteristics while eliminating wet chemical processes. Comprehensive post-transfer characterization verified retention of the defining single-photon characteristic, the second-order correlation function _g_(2)(0), and revealed an improvement of about 46%. This enhancement in photon purity may result from thermal desorption of weak surface contaminants during mild heating and from changes in local stress and strain induced by the transfer process. While _g_(2)(0) showed substantial improvement, other photophysical properties, such as emitter lifetime, emission spectrum, and photostability, remained nearly unchanged, indicating that the transfer preserves the overall optical quality. The technique achieves emitter survival probability of 81.8%, where success requires both the structural integrity of the transferred flake and the survival of the emitters with their defining optical properties. This high survival probability demonstrates the potential to scale the integration of single photon emitters across diverse photonic platforms. We expect that this process will contribute to applications of boron nitride defects in quantum technologies.

#### CONCLUSIONS

We have developed an all-dry transfer technique of quantum emitters hosted by the hBN crystals. Our transfer technique stands out for its remarkable simplicity and efficiency. It operates without involving any chemical solvents during the transfer process, ensuring a clean method that requires no post-cleaning. A significant advantage is the durability of the PDMS-PVC stamp; unless it is melted or otherwise damaged, a single stamp can be re-used for several transfers, with only the adhesion layer needing replacement, which is a straightforward and uncomplicated task. The tunable curvature area of the PDMS droplet adds versatility, making it highly convenient for different device configurations. Moreover, the process works with a relatively low temperature of 170 °C, which is easily achievable with standard hot plates. In addition, this is way below the activation temperature at which defects in hBN become mobile.60 Collectively, these features make our transfer technique practical, adaptable, and efficient for a wide range of applications. This is, in particular, useful when the emitter fabrication method requires special substrates, such as conducting substrates for localized charged particle irradiation. Our method has successfully demonstrated on the Si/SiO2 substrates. As Si and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures are widely used for fabricating waveguides and other photonic devices,66,67 we expect that our method can be broadly used in these cases. Furthermore, 2D materials adhere strongly to gold surfaces,68 whereas PVC’s adhesion becomes weaker at higher temperature. Therefore, our transfer method is expected to work well on gold-coated substrates. We have further applied the same PDMS–PVC-based approach to thin WS2 flakes (with an approximate thickness of 60–80 nm), achieving clean pick-up and transfer without mechanical damage. This demonstrates that the process can be compatible with other van der Waals materials. Hence, the method holds promise as a unified, all-dry transfer platform for a wide range of 2D materials—including transition-metal dichalcogenides69–73 and other layered crystals—thereby broadening its applicability across diverse photonic and quantum material systems.
