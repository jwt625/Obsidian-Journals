Narrow linewidth lasers have many applications, such as higher order coherent communications, optical sensing, and metrology. While semiconductor lasers are typically unsuitable for such applications due to relatively low coherence, recent advances in heterogeneous integration of III-V with silicon have shown that this is no longer true. In this tutorial, we discuss in-depth techniques that are used to drastically reduce the linewidth of a laser. The heterogeneous silicon-III/V platform can fully utilize these techniques, and fully integrated lasers with Lorentzian linewidth on the order of 100 Hz and tuning range of 120 nm are shown.

A theory of the spectral width of a single-mode semiconductor laser is presented and used to explain the recent measurements of Fleming and Mooradian on AlGaAs lasers. They found the linewidth to be inversely proportional to power and to have a value of 114 MHz at 1 mW per facet. This value is 30 times greater than can be explained by existing theories. The enhanced linewidth is attributed to the variation of the real refractive indexn'with carrier density. Spontaneous emission induces phase and intensity changes in the laser field. The restoration of the laser to its steady-state intensity results in changes in the imaginary part of the refractive index\Delta n". These changes are accompanied by changes in the real part of the refractive index\Delta n', which cause additional phase fluctuations and line broadening. The linewidth enhancement is shown to be1 + \alpha^{2}, where\alpha = \Delta n'/\Delta n". A value of\alpha \approx 5.4, needed to explain the observed linewidth, is close to the experimental values of a of 4.6 and 6.2.

Microelectronics are the cornerstone of the modern world, enhancing our daily lives by providing services such as communications and datacenters. These resources are accessible thanks to the continual pursuit of a deeper understanding of the chemical and physical phenomena underlying the materials synthesis approaches and fabrication processes used to create microelectronic components and subsequently the components' responses to electrical, optical, and other stimuli that are utilized within microelectronic systems. Today, further development of microelectronics requires multidisciplinary expertise across scientific disciplines and fields of study—synthesis, materials characterization, nanoscale fabrication, and performance characterization—with focus placed on comprehending the nanoscale forms and features of microelectronic components. The Nanoscale Science Research Centers (NSRCs) are Department of Energy, Office of Science user facilities that support the international scientific community in advancing nanoscale science and technology. As a key component of the U.S. Government's National Nanotechnology Initiative, the NSRCs enable transformative discoveries by providing world-class facilities, expertise, and collaborative opportunities. In this perspective, we showcase a non-exhaustive cross-section of the capabilities housed at and developed by the NSRCs and their user communities to address fundamental synthesis, metrology, fabrication, and performance considerations toward advancing the development of new microelectronics. Finally, we provide a timely outlook on the next major areas of necessary development in nanoscale sciences to continue the innovation of microelectronics into the next generation.

MEMS-based micro speakers are attractive candidates as sound transducers for smart devices, particularly wearables and hearables. For such devices, high sound pressure levels, low harmonic distortion and low power consumption are required for industrial, consumer and medical applications. The ability to integrate with microelectronic circuitry, as well as scalable batch production to enable low unit costs, are the key factors benchmarking a technology. The Nanoscopic Electrostatic Drive based, novel micro speaker concept presented in this work essentially comprises in-plane, electrostatic bending actuators, and uses the chip volume rather than the its surface for sound generation. We describe the principle, design, fabrication, and first characterization results. Various design options and governing equations are given and discussed. In a standard acoustical test setup (ear simulator), a MEMS micro speaker generated a sound pressure level of 69 dB at 500 Hz with a total harmonic distortion of 4.4%, thus proving the concept. Further potential on sound pressure as well as linearity improvement is outlined. We expect that the described methods can be used to enhance and design other MEMS devices and foster modeling and simulation approaches.

Modern lens designs are capable of resolving greater than 10 gigapixels, while advances in camera frame-rate and hyperspectral imaging have made data acquisition rates of Terapixel/second a real possibility. The main bottlenecks preventing such high data-rate systems are power consumption and data storage. In this work, we show that analog photonic encoders could address this challenge, enabling high-speed image compression using orders-of-magnitude lower power than digital electronics. Our approach relies on a silicon-photonics front-end to compress raw image data, foregoing energy-intensive image conditioning and reducing data storage requirements. The compression scheme uses a passive disordered photonic structure to perform kernel-type random projections of the raw image data with minimal power consumption and low latency. A back-end neural network can then reconstruct the original images with structural similarity exceeding 90%. This scheme has the potential to process data streams exceeding Terapixel/second using less than 100 fJ/pixel, providing a path to ultra-high-resolution data and image acquisition systems.

Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.

This study introduces the design and development of a core-sheath pressurized spinning method for producing hollow fibers on a larger scale than conventional methods. Multiple experimental designs were analyzed to determine the optimal hollow fiber structure. Polycaprolactone was used for the sheath layer, with four different core materials (empty, gas, ethanol, and oil) tested at rotational speeds of 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 rpm. Pressures of 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa were applied bilaterally and unilaterally to the vessel's core and sheath. A high-speed camera was used to observe the jetting behavior of the polymer solutions. Optimal operating parameters for each approach were found to be: empty core (sheath: 0–0.3—core: 0 MPa, at a rotational speed of 6000–8000 rpm), gas core (sheath: 0—core: 0.1–0.3 MPa, at a rotational speed of 4000–8000 rpm), ethanol core (sheath and core: 0–0.2 MPa, at a rotational speed of 4000–8000 rpm), and oil core (sheath and core: 0–0.1 MPa, at a rotational speed of 4000–6000 rpm). Surface morphology and size distribution were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy and a computed tomography scan, which confirmed the hollow structure. This design development offers a mean production of more than 30 times higher than coaxial electrospinning, achieving rates of 74.4, 62.4, 52.8, and 33.6 g h−1 for empty, gas, ethanol, and oil cores, respectively. The results show that this new design of core-sheath pressurized spinning can be successfully applied to large-scale production of hollow fibers, opening the path for new biomedical applications.

We present photonics intelligent design and optimization, a proof-of-concept multi-agent framework that converts natural-language photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design requests into layout mask files. This work demonstrates end-to-end PIC design automation using large language models (LLMs), with the goal of achieving structurally valid rather than performance-qualified layouts. We compare seven reasoning LLMs using a testbench of 102 design descriptions that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with ≤15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest end-to-end pass@5 success rates of ∼57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro requiring the fewest output tokens and the lowest cost. Future work will extend this framework toward performance qualification through expanded datasets, tighter simulation and optimization loops, and fabrication feedback integration.
