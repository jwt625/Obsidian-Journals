Done setting up the new wifi7 router and the synology NAS.
- Used mostly default settings for both of them
- SHR for the NAS

Wifi router not connected to the T-mobile fixed wireless yet. Too far.

Had to change the macos network service order to let it use wifi instead of ethernet:

Testing speed between mac mini and the NAS:

GbE feels it sucks after I used thunderbolt (1 GB/s, 10x faster). And it was not even thunderbolt 5 yet because I got a crappy M.2 enclosure.

Ok good for now. Going to continue backing up from DAS to NAS, and now I could access photos etc. from mac mini yay.
- will use DAS as backup after copying shit to NAS
