Trying to find if there is any dataset that could detect common lab tools and objects
- RF, microwave
- vacuum, cryogenics
- fiber optics
- equipments
- common tools: screw drivers, wrenches


Existing datasets:
- https://scale.com/blog/best-10-public-datasets-object-detection
- https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection

Existing works are almost 10 years old:
- https://paperswithcode.com/paper/visual-genome-connecting-language-and-vision

Some more recent work:
- https://github.com/leolyliu/TACO-Instructions


Is there no one working on the long tail problem??

SAM should help identifying the boundaries.
