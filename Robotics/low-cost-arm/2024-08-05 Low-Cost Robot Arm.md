Also still need to order all the other parts and tools.
And also need another table (ideally). Maybe I could use the existing desk for now.

Started printing ~ 15 min ago. No support. Chose the PLA strength default and reduced the outer shell from 6 to 4.

- the part with the curly tip did not stick around 35% maybe. Removed it
- all other ones are still printing fine

Found out I could add support to individual objects.

Still trying to find out where do I cancel objects.
