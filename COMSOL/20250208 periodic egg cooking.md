Because of this paper:
- https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-024-00334-w

Geometry?
- going to ask deepseek / mistral to generate a polygon
- axial symmetric sim

Hmm they say computational fluid dynamics but it is heat transfer:

- the degree of cooking is new:

Nice, properties of the egg given:

ok the water is done with CFD:

- hmm are the changes significant?

Going to ignore the changes:

Size:

Built the ellipse + circle model. Used harmonic perturbation. Have not used it in a while.

Good enough. Maybe another day for degree of cooking.
