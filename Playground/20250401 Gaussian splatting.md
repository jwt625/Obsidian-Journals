Going to try conda... Conda was installed by homebrew. I do not feel good about this...
```
conda env create --file environment.yml  
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```

Look at this shit:

Yeah of course:
```
wentaojiang@Wentaos-Mac-mini gaussian-splatting % conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/lib/python3.12/argparse.py:2006: FutureWarning: `remote_definition` is deprecated and will be removed in 25.9. Use `conda env create --file=URL` instead.

CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'
```

Cursor suggestions:
-    conda config --add channels nvidia
-    conda update conda
-    conda init

Do I need CUDA for this??

Going to try the garden preset.
holy shit the example just trains.

To prep data:
- https://github.com/jonstephens85/colmap-gradio
Following instructions inside:
`brew install colmap`
- damn this is taking a while
- 2025-04-01T22:52:54-07:00
- ok done
`brew install imagemagick`
- done. This one is quick

```
conda create --name colmap_env python=3.9 --no-default-packages -y
conda activate colmap_env
```
- Hmm always had to run `source ~/.zshrc` after `conda init` to make `conda activate` work...

```
git clone https://github.com/jonstephens85/colmap-gradio.git
cd colmap-gradio
pip install gradio==4.43.0
```

2025-04-01T23:01:12-07:00
ok all run and installed.

Moment of truth: `python colmap_gradio.py`
- of course this fucking python is linked to a different python
- going to try the installation in cursor

Ok I had to run this freaking line of code:
- `/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/colmap_env/bin/python colmap_gradio.py `
- seems like it is running!
![[Pasted image 20250401230533.png]]

2025-04-03T21:04:26-07:00
It took 6 hours to train. Forgot to update yesterday morning.
![[Pasted image 20250403210536.png]]

# Trying my own images
Should try the training data preparation with COLMAP.
Stupid freaking python.
- `Â /opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/colmap_env/bin/python colmap_gradio.py`

`

Fuck HEIC.
- `for f in *.HEIC; do sips -s format png "$f" --out "${f%.*}.png"; done`

2025-04-03T21:25:45-07:00
okay now it seems to be running COLMAP in Gradio fine.

![[Pasted image 20250403212710.png]]

This is not going to work...
2025-04-03T21:32:48-07:00
Well it is actually working??
![[Pasted image 20250403213254.png]]
I'm going to 3DGS all the shit I've done teardown.
Looks amazing man:
![[Pasted image 20250403221100.png]]

2025-04-03T22:14:54-07:00
Took photos of the innolight transceiver.
Also why are the png files 10x larger than heic??

2025-04-03T23:22:22-07:00
innolight & servo adapter

ASked chatGPT for options:
- https://github.com/antimatter15/splat?tab=readme-ov-file
	- looks pretty good
- https://github.com/mkkellogg/GaussianSplats3D
	- hmm this seems more general, and three.js based

Going to try the three.js based one.
- holy it almost froze my computer..

2025-04-04T00:23:00-07:00

The default scene is from
```
const url = new URL(
    params.get("url") || "train.splat",
    "https://huggingface.co/cakewalk/splat-data/resolve/main/"
);

```

Converting ply to splat:
- `python3 convert.py your_model.ply --output your_model.splat`
- installed `plyfile`
- `python3 convert.py innolight.ply --output test.splat`
- converted
- 

2025-04-04T00:29:15-07:00
Ok got it rendered locally. However it looks worse. The spherical harmonic order is lower?
![[Pasted image 20250404004137.png]]
Yes it is because of the spherical harmonics order.
It is from this section in `convert.py`:
```
SH_C0 = 0.28209479177387814

color = np.array(
[
0.5 + SH_C0 * v["f_dc_0"],
0.5 + SH_C0 * v["f_dc_1"],
0.5 + SH_C0 * v["f_dc_2"],
1 / (1 + np.exp(-v["opacity"])),
]
)
```

ugh files are also too big:
- https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files
- the splat is only 20.9 MB though
- going to ignore the ply file.

2025-04-04T01:04:04-07:00
Deployed. Took a while for the pages to actually run and become active:
- https://jwt625.github.io/splat/
Looks like crap though because of zeroth order only.
![[Pasted image 20250404010453.png]]

## Make the webGL rendering with 3rd order spherical harmonics
2025-04-04T21:48:40-07:00
Updated `convert.py`
Now the splat file is ~150 MB.
Need to figure out large file on github.
- `git lfs install`
	- error
	- `brew install git-lfs`
	- ok now the above runs
- `git lfs track "*.splat"`

2025-04-04T21:55:41-07:00
What is this bullshit
![[Pasted image 20250404215546.png]]

Going to create a new repo.
2025-04-04T22:03:46-07:00
Done.
- https://github.com/jwt625/splat-lfs
2025-04-04T22:14:31-07:00
Hmm github page not working,  likely because it is using the small pointer file. Piece of shit git LFS.
Going to host the splat on hugging face.

2025-04-04T22:35:13-07:00
Tried loading the -v2 that has up to 3rd SH. Froze my browser. Fuck.

2025-04-04T23:06:12-07:00
Testing up to 0~1 SH.
- `python3 convert.py innolight.ply --output test.splat --sh_order 1`

2025-04-04T23:08:43-07:00
ok even this freeze the browser. It must be the rendering.

2025-04-04T23:28:25-07:00
ok actually read and understood convert.py.

## How does the rendering work?

2025-04-05T00:24:11-07:00
Still trying to understand the rendering
- https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/blob/main/crates/brush-render/src/gaussian_splats.rs
- ok here is the actual rendering part: https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/blob/main/crates/brush-render/src/shaders/project_visible.wgsl
- I see the same SH_C0 coefficient, great.
- there are some magic numbers. Reference:
	- https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/06/
	- ![[Pasted image 20250405003404.png]]
Ok thank you o3-mini-high:
![[Pasted image 20250405003905.png]]
Useful stuff from the paper:
![[Pasted image 20250405004133.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250405004257.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250405004311.png]]

2025-04-05T00:47:51-07:00
Now the wgsl code makes more sense. Can I just use this wgsl, or get a glsl version?
Will continue after sleep.
