Cloning the repo:
- https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting
Paper:
- https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/

Going to try conda... Conda was installed by homebrew. I do not feel good about this...
```
conda env create --file environment.yml  
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```

Look at this shit:

Yeah of course:
```
wentaojiang@Wentaos-Mac-mini gaussian-splatting % conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/lib/python3.12/argparse.py:2006: FutureWarning: `remote_definition` is deprecated and will be removed in 25.9. Use `conda env create --file=URL` instead.

CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'
```

Cursor suggestions:
-    conda config --add channels nvidia
-    conda update conda
-    conda init

Do I need CUDA for this??

Going to try the garden preset.
holy shit the example just trains.

To prep data:
- https://github.com/jonstephens85/colmap-gradio
Following instructions inside:
`brew install colmap`
- damn this is taking a while
- 2025-04-01T22:52:54-07:00
- ok done
`brew install imagemagick`
- done. This one is quick

```
conda create --name colmap_env python=3.9 --no-default-packages -y
conda activate colmap_env
```
- Hmm always had to run `source ~/.zshrc` after `conda init` to make `conda activate` work...

```
git clone https://github.com/jonstephens85/colmap-gradio.git
cd colmap-gradio
pip install gradio==4.43.0
```

2025-04-01T23:01:12-07:00
ok all run and installed.

Moment of truth: `python colmap_gradio.py`
- of course this fucking python is linked to a different python
- going to try the installation in cursor

Ok I had to run this freaking line of code:
- `/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/colmap_env/bin/python colmap_gradio.py `
- seems like it is running!

It took 6 hours to train. Forgot to update yesterday morning.
![[Pasted image 20250403210536.png]]

Should try the training data preparation with COLMAP.
Stupid freaking python.
- `Â /opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/colmap_env/bin/python colmap_gradio.py`

Fuck HEIC.
- `for f in *.HEIC; do sips -s format png "$f" --out "${f%.*}.png"; done`

2025-04-03T21:25:45-07:00
okay now it seems to be running COLMAP in Gradio fine.

This is not going to work...
2025-04-03T21:32:48-07:00

Took photos of the innolight transceiver.
Also why are the png files 10x larger than heic??
