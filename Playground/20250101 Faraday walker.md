# Literatures

Found it because of this paper:
- Pranav2024: Influence of amplitude and harmonic frequencies on the velocity of Faraday superwalkers
- https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/36/12/122142/3328030/Influence-of-amplitude-and-harmonic-frequencies-on

Other good read:
- Couder2005: Walking and orbiting droplets: https://www.nature.com/articles/437208a
- Couder2005: From Bouncing to Floating: Noncoalescence of Drops on a Fluid Bath: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.177801
- Perrard2014: Self-organization into quantized eigenstates of a classical wave-driven particle: https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4219
	- Couder is the last author lol
	- this one showed funny orbits
- Valani2020: Emergence of superwalking droplets

# What liquid / oil? Droplet size?
Target viscosity 10 ~ 100 cP.

# Shaker

Requirements:
- 10 ~ 100 Hz
- 2~10 g acceleration
- DeepSeek calculated 0.1 mm amplitude let's say we aim for ~ 1 mm
- Easily doable with a subwoofer:

## Their shaker in Pranav2024
They showed the shaker:

Looks like an overkill.

Going to get a subwoofer and a driver because I do not want to ruin my speakers:
