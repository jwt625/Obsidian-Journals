`GitHub\PlayGround\20241017_tree_history`

# Initial version
2024-10-20T11:11:34-07:00
Worked on tracking browsing using chrome plugin yesterday.

Trying to visualize the tree right now.

Following claude:
Using https://d3js.org/getting-started

To use this updated version:

1. Save the HTML content to a file (e.g., `tree-visualization.html`).
2. Create a file named `tabTree.json` in the same directory as your HTML file.
3. Copy your JSON data into `tabTree.json`. Make sure it's valid JSON.
4. Due to browser security restrictions, you'll need to serve these files from a web server rather than opening the HTML file directly. You can use a simple local server for development purposes. Here are a couple of options:
    - If you have Python installed:
        - For Python 3.x: Run `python -m http.server` in the directory containing your files.
        - For Python 2.x: Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the directory containing your files.
    - If you have Node.js installed:
        - Install `http-server` globally: `npm install -g http-server`
        - Run `http-server` in the directory containing your files.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever port your server is using).
6. Click on `tree-visualization.html` to view your visualization.

This approach separates your data from your visualization code, making it easier to update the data independently. It also allows for potentially larger datasets without bloating your HTML file.

## TODO
Tracker side:
- get thumbnail
- [x] add button to start and stop tracking
	- maybe also a timer for duration of the tracking
- [x] integrate the viewer directly into the plugin
- [x] track also the top five occurrence words?
Viewer side:
- display more details when hovering?
- dynamic move the nodes when hovering and displaying more details?

# Migrating to Claude projects

2024-10-22T22:12:29-07:00

Going to feed it the existing project files.

It recommended the following order for the new features:
Suggested Implementation Order:
1. [x] Start/Stop Tracking (fundamental control feature)
2. [x] Word Frequency Analysis (data enrichment, no UI changes needed)
3. [x] Integrated Viewer (foundation for other viewer features)
4. Thumbnails (more complex, requires storage handling)
5. Enhanced Hover Details (builds on previous features)
6. Dynamic Node Movement (polish feature)
7. Duration Timer (optional enhancement)

As well as additional features:
1. Search/Filter functionality based on:
    - Word frequency data
    - Time ranges
    - Domain patterns
2. Export options (different formats)
3. Session management (save/load different tracking sessions)
4. Tab grouping visualization
5. Statistics dashboard

2024-10-22T22:58:29-07:00
Implementing start/stop tracking, as well as word count.
2024-10-22T23:28:20-07:00
Tested and committed. Going to integrate the viewer tomorrow.

2024-10-23T08:01:05-07:00
- add different icons for different status
- better logging

# Viewer integration

2024-10-23T21:10:34-07:00
Asked Claude to plan out the viewer integration process.
It generated a few overview and process / flow charts:

```
extension/
├── popup/
│   ├── popup.html    (simple controls & mini preview)
│   └── popup.js      (basic interactions)
├── viewer/
│   ├── viewer.html   (full visualization page)
│   ├── viewer.js     (main visualization logic)
│   └── components/   (modular visualization components)
│       ├── tree.js   (D3.js tree rendering)
│       ├── controls.js (layout/view controls)
│       └── details.js (node details/hover panel)
├── background.js
└── manifest.json
```

Component comm flow:
```
Background Script <--> Viewer Page
         ↑
         |
      Popup UI
```

Data flow:

```
[Background]     [Storage]        [Viewer]
  Tree Data  -->  Chrome  -->  Initial Load
     |            Storage         |
  Updates  ---------------------->|  (via message passing)
     |                           |
  Changes  <----------------------|  (if we add interactive features)
```


Should try to debug the tracker errors before moving on to integrating viewer.

background.js:166 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')
    at initializeEventListeners (background.js:166:17)
    at background.js:187:5

2024-10-23T21:49:41-07:00 debug of missing functions and permission of alarms resolved.

2024-10-23T23:27:05-07:00
Ok a lot of suffering to rewrite the background.js and improve the viewer.
- plugin popup looks much nicer:
![[Pasted image 20241023234228.png]]
The toggle animation is glitched for some of the leaf nodes.
- 2024-10-23T23:40:06-07:00: mostly fixed. 


TODO:
- fix the plugin popup failed to initialize when the viewer tab is open

2024-10-24T21:53:06-07:00
Still debugging the popup fail to initialize when having the viewer open.
When viewer tab is not present:
![[Pasted image 20241024215331.png]]

When viewer present:
![[Pasted image 20241024215400.png]]
Maybe should gave up/pause on this first...

TODO:
- add button in the viewer to load an existing json
- add button to zoom in and out along x and y
- add hovering to display extra info

# Improving viewer
2024-10-26T12:41:23-07:00

## New Claud chat

>I'll analyze these features and provide recommendations for implementation priority based on user value, technical complexity, and building on existing functionality.

Recommended Implementation Order:

1. First Wave (High Value, Builds on Existing):
- Search/Filter functionality in viewer
  - Already have word frequency data and timestamps
  - Relatively straightforward to implement with existing D3 visualization
  - High user value for navigating larger trees
  - Suggested implementation:
    ```javascript
    - Add filter controls to viewer UI
    - Filter nodes based on criteria while maintaining tree structure
    - Highlight/fade nodes based on filter matches
    ```

- Statistics Dashboard
  - Uses existing data
  - Provides immediate value
  - Helps validate tracking functionality
  - Could show:
    - Most visited domains
    - Peak browsing times
    - Common navigation patterns
    - Word frequency trends

2. Second Wave (Enhanced Functionality):
- Export Options
  - Natural extension of existing save functionality
  - Add support for CSV, PDF, PNG formats
  - Include visualization export

- Hover Details in Viewer
  - Builds on existing node interaction
  - Show additional metadata like:
    - Full URL
    - Visit duration
    - Word frequency details
    - Navigation path

3. Third Wave (New Features):
- Tab Classification/Grouping
  - Use existing word frequency data for automatic categorization
  - Add manual grouping capabilities
  - Enhance visualization with group colors/sections

- Session Management
  - Add session controls to popup
  - Implement storage management
  - Allow naming/organizing sessions

4. Final Wave (Complex Features):
- Track Duration Time
  - Requires background tracking enhancement
  - Add duration to node metadata
  - Update visualization to show duration

- Thumbnails
  - Most complex due to storage/performance implications
  - Consider lazy loading
  - Implement storage cleanup strategy

Additional Suggestions:

1. Enhancement Ideas:
- Keyboard shortcuts for viewer navigation
- Customizable node colors/styles based on patterns
- Tab behavior analysis (identify similar navigation patterns)
- Integration with browser bookmarks
- Custom tagging system

2. Technical Improvements:
```javascript
// Add data compression for storage efficiency
const compressTreeData = (treeData) => {
  // Implement compression logic
};

// Add batch processing for performance
const batchProcessNodes = (nodes, batchSize = 50) => {
  // Process nodes in batches
};

// Add data validation/cleanup
const validateTreeData = (data) => {
  // Implement validation logic
};
```

3. UX Enhancements:
- Quick filters for common patterns
- Preset views (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Drag-and-drop node organization
- Context menu for common actions
- Mini-map for large trees

Priority Rationale:
1. Focus first on features that enhance usability of existing functionality
2. Add features that help users understand their browsing patterns
3. Implement complex features last when core functionality is solid

Technical Considerations:
- Implement data cleanup/optimization before adding storage-heavy features
- Consider browser storage limits when adding features
- Plan for scalability with larger trees
- Consider performance impact of real-time updates

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or provide more detailed implementation guidance for specific features?


## Update 20241026, 3 pm
2024-10-26T14:58:49-07:00

Ok improved the zoom, improved text display near the node for different zoom.
Added hover detail display and improved it.


# Move to new repo
2024-10-27T09:36:06-07:00

Should move it to a separate repo.
Also things need to be fixed on the tracker side:
- close time missing for some cases
- new tab is being tracked
- add crawling thumbnail
- still creates duplicated nodes when current tab creates a new tab
On the viewer side:
- remove the separate x and y zoom
- add save button to do the same as the save button in the popup
- add bookmark/tagging to the viewer nodes
