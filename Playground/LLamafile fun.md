Took ~ 2 h to download the Mixtral8x7B model.
It does not work because of windows file size limit: https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#gotchas

Found the same issue from someone else: https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/issues/4881
- Reading through it and followed to this issue: https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/issues/1000

23:30 Finally finished the download about ~ 15 min ago. It runs.

Done for now.
