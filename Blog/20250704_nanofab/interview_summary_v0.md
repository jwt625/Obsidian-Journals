##### Assistant:

Thanks for sharing your Google Scholar page. I’ve gone through the listed publications and grouped key papers by relevance to **nanofabrication**, especially focusing on those involving **optomechanics**, **phononic crystals**, **thin-film lithium niobate**, and **device integration**. Below is a structured overview:

---

## **1. High-Impact Nanofabrication-Relevant Papers**

### **A. Optomechanical and Piezo-Optomechanical Crystals**

These papers heavily involve complex nanofabrication workflows, including lithography, etching, and heterogeneous integration.

- **“High photon-phonon pair generation rate in a two-dimensional optomechanical crystal”**  
    _Nature Communications (2025)_  
    Likely includes detailed 2D phononic crystal fabrication with co-localized optical and acoustic modes. Expect nanobeam or nanomembrane structures in Si or LiNbO₃.

##### You said:

Ok great. Let's do a ~30 min interview, with a combination of professional topics, as well as keep it fun and occasionally light and entertaining. The goal of the interview is to extract my experience and knowledge as much as possible, about nanofabrication, and about my experience in the stanford facilities. I have spent almost 10 years in academic cleanroom, and ~ 7 years at the stanford facilities, with countless hours on various tools. There are also unpublished results, so you could ask me about details in every tools i mentioned, from what i like and dont like about the tool, and what would go wrong etc. Let's give this a try. I will make the conversation enter voice mode after this message. Please use all your best reference for similar interviews as examples for guiding your questions, such as the ones from Lex Fridman, and Ben Thompson & John Gruber. Give me your high level plan and goals, as well as some example questions you would ask about a few relevant things or topics of your choice, so I could get a sense of your understanding.
