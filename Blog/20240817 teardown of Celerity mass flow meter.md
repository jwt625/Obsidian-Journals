Screws removed:
- two on the flaps of the case that connect the case to the in and out port flange
- two on the two sides of the D-type connector
- cut the seal, now could lift off the case
- one on the back of the PCB that mounts it to the side of the sensor. It also holds the insulating paper between the back of the PCB and the inner side of the case (preventing electrical short)

The board with the connectors can be unplugged from the main board

The enclosure is actually part of a voice coil / solenoid.
Further open the lid underneath the solenoid, there is a flexure inside, and a manifold to guide the gas around.

Going to open the sensor tomorrow.
