openai's chatgpt voice mode sucks:

I spent last night building my own streaming with whisper, but it sucks, breaking the words into pieces.

Also tried to use assembly AI. Need to pay to use streaming although the website shows I have credits for streaming:

Test story and transcription:

```markdown
**The Magic Coffee Shop**

Every morning, Sarah walked past the small coffee shop on Maple Street. The sign read "Luna's CafÃ©" in faded blue letters. She had never gone inside because it always seemed closed, even during busy hours.

One rainy Tuesday, Sarah decided to try the door. To her surprise, it opened with a gentle chime. Inside, an elderly woman with silver hair smiled warmly.

"Welcome, dear. I've been waiting for you," the woman said, pouring steaming coffee into a blue ceramic cup. "This is our special blend. It helps people find what they're looking for."

Sarah took a sip. The coffee tasted like cinnamon and dreams. Suddenly, she remembered her childhood goal of becoming a writer. She had forgotten it years ago while working at the bank.

"Thank you," Sarah whispered, placing coins on the counter.

When she turned back from the door, the shop had vanished. Only an empty lot remained, with a small blue cup sitting on the sidewalk.

Sarah picked up the cup and smiled. She knew exactly what she was looking for now.

`brew install blackhole-2ch`.

Have to setup this loopback because of stupid macos:

2025-06-28T22:09:14-07:00
Almost there, just need a multi-input device

Getting this:

- actually no, should just figure out how to capture system audio
