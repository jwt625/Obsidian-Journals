Got the 3D scanning results from Bryan.

The `.obj` file actually opens in the WIndows 3D viewer:

Could even put the model in mixed reality lol:

Convert to stl/step:

In blender:

Exported to stl. Now it is 28 MB big.

In bambu studio:

Going to trim it in Blender:

## Trimming
### Step 1: Enter Edit Mode

1. Open your model in **Blender**.
2. Select the model and press `Tab` to enter **Edit Mode**.

### Step 2: Select and Delete Branches or Leaves

1. **Select Branches/Leaves**: Use the `B` key to box-select vertices, edges, or faces of the branches and leaves you want to trim. You can also use `C` for circle selection or `L` to select linked vertices.
    
    - **Tip**: Use `X-ray Mode` (press `Alt+Z`) to select through the model, making it easier to grab all relevant geometry.
2. **Delete the Selection**: After selecting the parts you want to remove, press `X` and choose **Vertices**, **Edges**, or **Faces** to delete the selected geometry.
    

### Step 3: Simplify the Mesh

1. **Use the Decimate Modifier**:
    - If your tree model is still too complex, you can apply the **Decimate Modifier** to reduce the polygon count.
    - Go to the **Modifier Properties** panel, add a **Decimate Modifier**, and adjust the **Ratio** slider to simplify the mesh.

### Step 4: Check and Clean Up

1. **Remove Doubles**: In Edit Mode, press `M > Merge by Distance` to remove overlapping vertices.

- This merge is the best

1. **Check for Non-Manifold Edges**: Go to `Select > Select All by Trait > Non-Manifold` to find and fix any problematic edges that might cause issues during printing.

Now it looks better in bambu:

## Fixing selection in Blender:
To select everything inside the selection box, including elements hidden behind other geometry, you'll need to enable **X-ray mode** or disable **Limit selection to visible**. Here's how to do it:

### Method 1: Enable X-ray Mode

1. Press `Alt+Z` to toggle **X-ray mode** on. This mode makes the model semi-transparent, allowing you to select geometry through the model.
2. Now, when you use `B` for box selection or `C` for circle selection, Blender will select everything within the selection area, including hidden geometry.

### Method 2: Disable Limit Selection to Visible

1. If you prefer not to use X-ray mode, you can disable the **Limit selection to visible** option.
2. In the top bar of the 3D Viewport, next to the selection tools, there's a small icon that looks like two overlapping squares (in older versions of Blender, it's a cube with dots). Click this icon to disable it.
3. With this option disabled, your selection will include geometry hidden behind other parts of the model.

Now you should be able to select everything inside the selection area, even if itâ€™s not directly visible from your current viewpoint.
