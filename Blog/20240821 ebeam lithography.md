I should just start writing.

I started shadowing on fab in mid 2015. I might actually still have the cleanroom notebook with me. It is going to kickstart a lot of nostalgia... It made me realize how many different details there are, and how little I knew or still remember... Anyway, I'm brave enough to decided I should just start writing. 

  

# Outline:

  

## My journey

- History

- Raith 150 Two (2015 - 2017)
	- Why is the GUI completely frozen when the sample plate is loading or unloading? Why can't I check my patterns or configure the beam/column parameters?
	- Why is there a joystick? Some people might like it but I absolutely do not want to accidentally bumped into it. Disabling the x and y channel on the joystick is the first thing I do when I got to the tool.

- JEOL JBX 6300FS (2017 - 2022)
	- It is perfect, please do not change.
	- Hmm maybe make it easier to copy the log message from the GUI. Maybe this is partly because of the linux system, it took me a while to figure out I have to triple click to "select-all, and then drag-drop while holding the SCROLLING WHEEL to copy the log messages out.

- Raith Voyager (2022 - 2023)
	- Same complains as Raith 150 Two. Very similar in terms of user experience.

- EBPG 5200+ (2023 - 2024)

- Number of sessions (~ 420 total)

- 2023 - 2024: 60? Played with proximity effect correction a lot during this time.

- 2021 - 2022: 109. Started and perfected automatic mark detection and alignment on JEOL.

- 2019 - 2021: 92 (damn covid)

- 2017 - 2018: 73 + 89, developing a certain fab process, was doing beamwrite almost every week, sometimes more than once a week.

- pre 2017: sporadic

- Ebeam resist: CSAR, MMA/PMMA, HSQ

  

## Ebeam basics

- How stable do things need to be
- 

- Why is the column this big

- Where are the electrons going

- focusing (how is it done)

- current measurement

- beam calibration

- Where is the stage going

- interferometer

- writefield (WF) size, calibration, stitching

- subfield (maybe?)

- beam parameters

- Voltage, current

- shot pitch

- dose (DAC rate limit, dose sweep)

  

## Practical

- What resist to use

- positive vs. negative

- adhesion

- discharge layer

- selectivity

- liftoff

- Fracturing (BEAMER)

- Oh god maybe this should be a different yap-post

- I should still start to write down things that matters

- Field control: fixed, manual, different ways to meander, fully manual with layers...

- multipass

- PEC

- Mounting your chip

- front vs. back referenced

- height measurement (under uscope, in the tool with the LED)

- multiple chips

- Locating your chip

- optical microscope / camera assistance

- using the SEM

- Alignment

- desired marks (materials, thickness, locations, reusability)

- how to find the marks (manual & auto, mark params, scan params)

- develop

- remove discharge layer

- be wary water + IPA could develop some resist unintentionally

- feedback & optimization

- dose sweep

- optimize your own workflow

- better estimation of the exposure time

- What is the bottleneck? What can be automated?

- TBA...
