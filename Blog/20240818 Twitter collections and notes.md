# Production

2024-12-01T23:43:34-08:00
I figure I should start taking notes about the progress of how I produce my tweets.
Most of them are screenshots, which are easy.
Major new things are videos, where I do not want to pay youtube premium for downloading yet.
Thus I am currently using OBS to record the screen, and then process (crop etc.) in iMovie.
