But this is only for personal drive. I do want some from the shared drive.
Do I have to get a mouse clicker thingy?

Fuck APIs:
‚è∫ Best automation approaches:

  1. Selenium (Recommended)
  - Most reliable for web automation
  - Can handle authentication
  - Works with dynamic content

  2. Playwright
  - Modern alternative to Selenium
  - Better performance
  - Built-in waiting mechanisms

  3. Mouse/Keyboard Automation
  - PyAutoGUI (fragile, screen-dependent)
  - AppleScript on macOS (limited)

```

  pip install playwright
  playwright install chromium
  python playwright_drive.py

```

damn google.

This is a common issue with organization-managed Google
  accounts. Google Drive can detect automation in several ways:

  Why "Not Signed In" Appears

  1. Organization Security Policies
  - Your org likely has policies blocking automated access
  - Even with manual login, Drive detects the automated browser
  - Managed accounts have stricter security than personal ones

  2. Automation Detection
  - Google detects Playwright/automation markers
  - Browser fingerprinting identifies non-human usage
  - Session validation fails automated checks

  3. Cookie/Session Issues
  - Automation browsers often have isolated cookie stores
  - Drive requires specific session tokens
  - Cross-domain authentication may fail

  Solutions to Try

  Option 1: Use Your Personal Profile
  # Modify the browser setup to use your existing Chrome profile
  async def setup_browser(self, headless=False):
      playwright = await async_playwright().start()

      # Use your existing Chrome profile
      self.context = await
  playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
          user_data_dir="/Users/wentaojiang/Library/Application 
  Support/Google/Chrome/Default",
          headless=headless,
          args=[
              '--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled',
              '--disable-web-security'
          ]
      )
      self.page = await self.context.new_page()

  Option 2: Enhanced Stealth Mode
  Want me to update the script with better stealth features?

  Option 3: Alternative Approaches
  - Browser Extension: Create a Chrome extension for downloading
  - Bookmarklet: JavaScript snippet for manual triggering
  - Screen Recording: Capture manual downloads for automation

  Option 4: Organization Workarounds
  - Ask IT to whitelist automation for your account
  - Use a personal Google account to access shared files
  - Request IT to perform the export for you

  Which approach would you like to try first? The personal
  Chrome profile method often works best for managed accounts.

Yeees using firebox works.

2025-06-15T22:55:54-07:00
Download working, hell yeah. Slow though, 5~10 s per file.
- 6 months is still 1 million files, guess I should get this start running

2025-06-15T23:58:45-07:00
Going into folders and downloading works. Going back not working.
Stupid piece of shit, why not just use the browser's going back button??

2025-06-16T23:15:33-07:00
Hell yeah fixed the navigation and slow download. It is waiting for a 30 s timeout.

Now debugging the download too fast and start skipping files...
ok fuck this:

Had to fix it again for all popups.
Seems to run fine now, running on QAOM drive.
