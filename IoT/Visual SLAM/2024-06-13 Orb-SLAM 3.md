# Installation
22:56 Got [Oracle VM virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed and fired up ubuntu 18.04
![[Pasted image 20240613225741.png]]

Damn I have not used any VM for a long long time. Nostalgia is hitting me.

23:17 Have to switch to root, otherwise cannot sudo:
![[Pasted image 20240613231712.png]]

23:19 Now cloning opencv. I need better and faster internet.
23:28 Building. Pretty satisfying to watch.
- "The third command configures the build using CMake with specific options, including setting the build type to “Release,” disabling the use of CUDA, and specifying the installation prefix."
23:32 Installing. This is quick, done in 5 s.

I need to fix the clipboard across the VM. It is too annoying. Or maybe also just take notes inside the VM.

23:35 Ok first error: could not find OpenGL. Asking chatGPT.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libgl1-mesa-dev

sudo apt install libglew-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libpython2.7-dev python-numpy

glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"

```

glxinfo not found. Installing it (`sudo apt install mesa-utils`). Seems like OpenGL is here.
- OpenGL version: `3.1 Mesa 20.0.8`

23:41 Rebuild Pangolin... Ok now `cmake` runs without any error. Running `make`.

23:43 Finally cloning ORB_SLAM3. Too many shit to download. Why is gedit taking forever to open??

23:47 Getting some fatal error lol
![[Pasted image 20240613234747.png]]

chatGPT suggests installing `libboost-all-dev`

23:52 Okay now no fatal error! But `./build.sh` still failed.

Well let's see if we could run anything. Uhh freak this is a big dataset (EuRoc)...

2024-06-14 00:05 Downloaded.
00:07 Seems like the build did not work. No binary of `mono_euroc` under `Example/Monocular`. Give up. Going to sleep for now.

## Second attempt

2024-06-14 22:19, re-setup ubuntu.
22:41 Found enable EFI does not work, would run into no mounted drive found error.

22:58 Mounted the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso by hand and ran it in the VM and finally got the bidirectional clipboard working.

23:08 building opencv...
23:13 fixing openGL
23:20 building ORB-SLAM3. Running into the same fatal error.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
dpkg -s libboost-dev | grep 'Version'

```

Getting `Version: 1.65.1.0ubuntu1`

23:24 fatal error gone. chatGPT says now Eigen3 is missing.
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```

Trying to build again. Seems to be running. Getting a lot of DEPRECATED warning/notes. Also one more fatal error.

23:26 now the VM is frozen... Recovered after ~ 1 min. Still spitting out all kinds of errors and warnings.

![[Pasted image 20240614232735.png]]

23:41 Had to kill and restart the VM. Maybe the video memory is too small.
New fatal erorr:
```
/root/Dev/ORB_SLAM3/src/System.cc:26:10: fatal error: openssl/md5.h: No such file or directory
 #include <openssl/md5.h>
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
CMakeFiles/ORB_SLAM3.dir/build.make:62: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/ORB_SLAM3.dir/src/System.cc.o' failed

```

Checking Eigen3 installation:
`ls /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen`

chatGPT also recommended cleanup the previous build:
```
rm -rf Thirdparty/g2o/build
rm -rf build

```

Also going to take a look inside the `build.sh`:
```
echo "Configuring and building Thirdparty/DBoW2 ..."

cd Thirdparty/DBoW2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j

cd ../../g2o

echo "Configuring and building Thirdparty/g2o ..."

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j

cd ../../../

echo "Uncompress vocabulary ..."

cd Vocabulary
tar -xf ORBvoc.txt.tar.gz
cd ..

echo "Configuring and building ORB_SLAM3 ..."

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j
```

23:44 Rerun the shell script, it ran to
```
[ 96%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/g2o.dir/g2o/core/optimization_algorithm_levenberg.cpp.o
```
and then started spitting out warnings.
Going to try letting it run and see if it finishes since it reached 96%.
`DBoW2` seems to have finished building. Now building `g2o`. Same warnings.

New errors:
```

```

23:52 Trying to turn off warning message. Adding the following line to `CMakeLists.txt`
```
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -w")

```
- also need to add to the third party CMakeList.txt

23:55 Ok the warnings are gone. Same fatal error about openssl.
Install open ssl:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

Now building again.
Fuck still did not work. New internal compiler errors:
```

```

ChatGPT suggest it is a memory issue.
2024-06-15 00:02 Increased video memory from 16 (?) MB to 128 MB, and memory from 8 GB to 16 GB.

00:04 building again. I'm seeing "Built target g2o"! The VM is extremely slow for some reason.
00:09 Holy jesus it is finally done. The VM got so slow I had to reboot it.

Now downloading the EuRoc dataset. Going to bath my feet.

00:25 It is running! Well it shows num_seq = 1. Maybe it needs more CPU... It is also only using a single core. How long is this suppose to take??
00:35 I'm going to leave it running and go sleep.

00:40 It worked! I ran example from https://github.com/kevin-robb/orb_slam_implementation
```
./Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Monocular/EuRoC.yaml ~/Datasets/EuRoc/MH01 ./Examples/Monocular/EuRoC_TimeStamps/MH01.txt dataset-MH01_mono
```
Ok I really should go sleep.
