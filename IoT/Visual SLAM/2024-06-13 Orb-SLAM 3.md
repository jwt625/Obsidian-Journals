# Installation
22:56 Got [Oracle VM virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed and fired up ubuntu 18.04

Damn I have not used any VM for a long long time. Nostalgia is hitting me.

23:17 Have to switch to root, otherwise cannot sudo:

23:19 Now cloning opencv. I need better and faster internet.
23:28 Building. Pretty satisfying to watch.
- "The third command configures the build using CMake with specific options, including setting the build type to “Release,” disabling the use of CUDA, and specifying the installation prefix."
23:32 Installing. This is quick, done in 5 s.

I need to fix the clipboard across the VM. It is too annoying. Or maybe also just take notes inside the VM.

23:35 Ok first error: could not find OpenGL. Asking chatGPT.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libgl1-mesa-dev

sudo apt install libglew-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libpython2.7-dev python-numpy

glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"

```

glxinfo not found. Installing it. Seems like OpenGL is here.
- OpenGL version: `3.1 Mesa 20.0.8`

23:41 Rebuild Pangolin... Ok now `cmake` runs without any error. Running `make`.

23:43 Finally cloning ORB_SLAM3. Too many shit to download. Why is gedit taking forever to open??

23:47 Getting some fatal error lol
![[Pasted image 20240613234747.png]]

chatGPT suggests installing `libboost-all-dev`

23:52 Okay now no fatal error! But `./build.sh` still failed.

Well let's see if we could run anything. Uhh freak this is a big dataset (EuRoc)...

00:07 Seems like the build did not work. No binary of `mono_euroc` under `Example/Monocular`. Give up. Going to sleep for now.
