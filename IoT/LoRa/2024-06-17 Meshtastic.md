# Picking antenna

See tests by the community: https://github.com/meshtastic/antenna-reports?tab=readme-ov-file
I'm going for Molex 206764-0050:
- https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/2067640100/9520958

Damn shipping is 7 bucks. What else do I need from Digikey?

# Case

Found this one looking pretty attractive: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6625731
- found it through public search on onshape lol:
![[Pasted image 20240618224245.png]]

Found his youtube channel and homepage:
- https://www.youtube.com/@slabua/videos
- https://www.slblabs.com/

No post about the meshtastic project.
Trying to identify the boards:
![[Pasted image 20240618223733.png]]

How tf are they this chip:
- Blue board: GPS module, $9: https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-GY-NEO6MV2-Controller-Ceramic-Antenna/dp/B01D1D0F5M
- Purple: BME280 temperature, humidity, pressure sensor: https://www.amazon.com/Sumklin-Temperature-Precision-Barometric-GY-BME280/dp/B0CHWKVJLH/
- Battery: https://www.amazon.com/3000mAh-974058-Rechargeable-Replacement-Electronic/dp/B09YQ393N2
- the thing on the top looks like the GPS antenna

Pbb need to read and learn how the HELTEC LoRa board work:
https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/

# Learning HELTEC LoRa board
23:22 Installed Arduino IDE:
![[Pasted image 20240618232250.png]]

Installing Heltec ESP32 library following:
- https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-this-library

Maybe I should start with more straightforward tutorials like this one:
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-bme280-arduino-ide-pressure-temperature-humidity/
- got it from asking perplexity
23:28 I am going to order the BME280 and the GPS modules from Amazon. Pbb also the battery.
How do I charge the battery?
- need a lithium polymer battery charger
23:37 Ordered. Going to sleep.

Actually there are people showing how to do it with meshtastic / Heltec V3 board:

# Battery & charger
2024-06-25T21:42:08-07:00
Turns out the charger I got is completely wrong.
- These are all RC car Lipo chargers.
- Both chatGPT and perplexity are useless.

Found this video:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIPmzSI-ItA&ab_channel=CreativeStuff
- He was testing this charger: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074M77J5M?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
- not available any more
- found this one in related: https://www.amazon.com/AKK-Battery-Charge-Charger-Inductrix/dp/B07FD741J7/ref=dp_prsubs_sccl_3/141-7734019-3313648
	- It does have `JST 1.25`. I'm ordering it.


Connector types:
- https://www.scondar.com/jst-connector-types/

Found some people are as confused:
- http://community.heltec.cn/t/wifi-lora-32-battery-connector-confusement/240/7
ChatGPT is also totally wrong:

Pins:

2024-06-25T23:03:51-07:00 Soldering done. Using GPIO 19 and 20.
- blue LED on the GPS module board is blinking.
- no position in app
- restarted app, now showing position is `disabled`
- Enable it and rebooting

2024-06-25T23:14:42-07:00 I'm going to call it a day and going to sleep now. Maybe it just takes time.



# BOM

Battery:
- got this one first, it is wrong / wrong connector https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YQ393N2/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A39OKXP5I8EI3U&psc=1
- these looks right: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VRZTHDL/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A3JZ0E8P9D7DI&psc=1
