See tests by the community: https://github.com/meshtastic/antenna-reports?tab=readme-ov-file
I'm going for Molex 206764-0050:
- https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/2067640100/9520958

Damn shipping is 7 bucks. What else do I need from Digikey?

# Case

Found this one looking pretty attractive: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6625731
- found it through public search on onshape lol:

Found his youtube channel and homepage:
- https://www.youtube.com/@slabua/videos
- https://www.slblabs.com/

No post about the meshtastic project.
Trying to identify the boards:
![[Pasted image 20240618223733.png]]

How tf are they this chip:
- Blue board: GPS module, $9: https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-GY-NEO6MV2-Controller-Ceramic-Antenna/dp/B01D1D0F5M
- Purple: BME280 temperature, humidity, pressure sensor: https://www.amazon.com/Sumklin-Temperature-Precision-Barometric-GY-BME280/dp/B0CHWKVJLH/
- Battery: https://www.amazon.com/3000mAh-974058-Rechargeable-Replacement-Electronic/dp/B09YQ393N2
- the thing on the top looks like the GPS antenna

Pbb need to read and learn how the HELTEC LoRa board work:
https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/

# Learning HELTEC LoRa board
23:22 Installed Arduino IDE:
![[Pasted image 20240618232250.png]]

Installing Heltec ESP32 library following:
- https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-this-library

Maybe I should start with more straightforward tutorials like this one:
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-bme280-arduino-ide-pressure-temperature-humidity/
- got it from asking perplexity
23:28 I am going to order the BME280 and the GPS modules from Amazon. Pbb also the battery.
How do I charge the battery?
- need a lithium polymer battery charger
23:37 Ordered. Going to sleep.

Actually there are people showing how to do it with meshtastic / Heltec V3 board:
